## Dependencies

_Note: I am using GitBash for Windows to complete all dependency requirements. You may download Git [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)._

Start by cloning the repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/davidhammaker/Item_Catalog.git
```

Navigate into the repository to complete _Installation Requirements_ below.

### Installation Requirements

It is recommended that you install all Python packages in a virtual environment. Documentation for setting up a virtual environment using `venv` may be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

After creating and activating a new virtual environment, run the following command to install the required packages:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
